# STAT-689--Statistical-Computations
<b>Graduate school course</b>
<b>Course content:</b>
• Getting Started Downloading and setting up R and python. The basic syntax of each language including function creation and important packages (e.g. numpy).
Jupyter notebooks and version control with git. The importance of vectorization. C/C++
versus R/python for loops. Timing code. Calling R from python and vice versa. Generating pseudo–random numbers.
• Linear Regression and Matrix Inversion Sweeping and the Cholesky decomposition for determining linear regression parameter fits. Implementations in R and
python. Applications of linear regression to splines and signal frequency detection.
• Optimization and Root Finding Optimization techniques such as Newton, quasi–
Newton, and Hessian approximation. Motivation from maximum likelihood theory and M–
estimators. Applications to various statistical models. Implementations in R and python.
• Mixture Models and MM/EM Algorithms Brief introduction to mixture models and maximum likelihood estimation. Maximization via EM / MM strategies. Implementations in R and python. Applications to clustering.
• Bayesian Models and Computation Statistical inference in the Bayesian framework. Posterior sampling via Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings. Implementations in R and
python and the STAN platform for MCMC.
• Overview of important R and python packages and student presentations.
